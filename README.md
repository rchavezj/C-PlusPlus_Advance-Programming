1. General Information
  The generic part of the syllabus contains detailed information about prohibiting
  cheating, due dates and times, submitting assignments, and verification of the submit.
  Read it carefully, as you will be held responsible for it.
  
  Directory : The directory /afs/cats.ucsc.edu/courses/cmps109-wm/ and its
  subdirectories contain all assignments, handouts, examples, old
  exams, etc.
  
  Piazza : https://piazza.com/ is for questions and discussions that are
  appropriate in the classroom or lab section.
  
  Assignments : All assignments must be submitted electronically and must
  work on the Unix servers (unix.ucsc.edu).
  
  Due Dates : Due dates are announced in the README files in the course directory.
  You must frequently check the README.
  
  Cheating : Cheating will not be tolerated. See the secion on cheating
  in the generic part of the syllabus.
  
  Grades : To pass the course, both the programming component and the
  testing component will be taken into consideration. Failing
  either component may be cause to fail the course. Your final
  grade will be computed as follows :
    Programming assignments : 5 × 10% = 50%
    Midterm and final tests in class : 2× 25% = 50%
    Summer quarter does not have an exam week.

2. Course Description from Catalog
  CMPS-109. Advanced Programming. An introduction to object-oriented techniques
  of software development including data abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism,
  and object-oriented design. Extensive practice using a computer to solve
  problems, including construction of graphical user interfaces and a multithreaded
  client/server application. Prerequisites : CMPS-012B/M or CMPS-013H.


3. Textbooks and References
  Only the first textbook (by Stroustrup) is listed as ‘‘required’’. The others are
  optional references.

      (1) Bjarne Stroustrup : Prog ramming Principles and Practice Using C++,
second edition. Addison-Wesley, 2014. ISBN 0-321-99278-4. This is an elementary
textbook for a first course in C++. The previous edition will also
work, or any other C++ textbook you may already have. It is strongly recommended
that you read a book advertising the use of C++11. Any C++ book not
discussing C++11 should be considered obsolete.

      (2) The C++ Resources Network : Use this site to find specific information about
various classes in the standard library.

      (3) C++11 : The New ISO C++ Standard FAQ :
http://www.stroustrup.com/C++11FAQ.html

      (4) Bjarne Stroustrup : The C++ Prog ramming Language, 4th edition. Addison-Wesley,
2013. This is the revised definitive description of C++11.
2014. 

      (5) Stanley B. Lippman, Josée Lajoie, Barbara E. Moo : C++ Primer, 5th edition.
Addison-Wesley, 2013. A good primer discussing C++11.

      (6) Nicolai M. Josuttis : The C++ Standard Library, 2nd edition: A Tutorial
and Reference. Addison-Wesley, 2012. A specific tutorial on the library, with
C++11.

      (7) JTC1/SC22/WG21 — The C++ Standards Committee : Latest publicly available
draft: N3797 Wor king Draft, Standard for Prog ramming Language

      (8) Bjarne Stroustrup : The Design and Evolution of C++. Addison-Wesley,
1994. This is a historical document where Stroustrup discusses his design
philosophy and how it derived from C with Classes.

      (9) P.J. Plauger, Alexander Stepanov, Meng Lee, David Musser : The C++ Standard
Template Library. Prentice-Hall, 2001. Detailed description of the
implementation of the STL, showing detailed code examples.

4. Detailed Syllabus.
  This course is about programming in C++, including C++11. Prior programming
  knowledge of ANSI C is assumed.

      (1) C vs C++. Some differences : Input/output, strings, vectors instead of standard
I/O, character and other arrays. Fundamental data types. Using the
Standard Template Library (STL).

      (2) Functions : pass by value, reference, and const reference. Namespaces.

      (3) Classes : interface and implementaton. Header files and file guards. Member
functions. Operator and function overloading.

      (4) Input and output streams. User-defined I/O operators. Formatting I/O.
  
      (5) Vectors and free store. Memory management Constructors and destructors.
Copying and assignment of objects. Pointers and references. Shared_ptr and
Unique_ptr.

      (6) Vectors and arrays. Copy and move constructors, and copy and move assignments.
Destructors. Explicit constructors.

      (7) Inheritance polymorphism and object-oriented programming. Abstract classes.
Virtual functions. Overriding functions and operators. Multiple inheritance
as interfaces.

      (8) Template polymorphism and generic programming. Containers and inheritance.
Range checking and resource management. Exceptions : defining,
throwing, and catching.

      (9) Containers and iterators in the standard library. Vectors, lists, and strings.
Algorithms and maps.

      (10) Graphical user interfaces (GUI). Threads. Sockets. Client/server applications.
      
      (11) Miscellaneous other topics : TBA.
