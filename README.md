      (1) Bjarne Stroustrup : Prog ramming Principles and Practice Using C++,
second edition. Addison-Wesley, 2014. ISBN 0-321-99278-4. This is an elementary
textbook for a first course in C++. The previous edition will also
work, or any other C++ textbook you may already have. It is strongly recommended
that you read a book advertising the use of C++11. Any C++ book not
discussing C++11 should be considered obsolete.

      (2) The C++ Resources Network : Use this site to find specific information about
various classes in the standard library.

      (3) C++11 : The New ISO C++ Standard FAQ :
http://www.stroustrup.com/C++11FAQ.html

      (4) Bjarne Stroustrup : The C++ Prog ramming Language, 4th edition. Addison-Wesley,
2013. This is the revised definitive description of C++11.
2014. 

      (5) Stanley B. Lippman, Josée Lajoie, Barbara E. Moo : C++ Primer, 5th edition.
Addison-Wesley, 2013. A good primer discussing C++11.

      (6) Nicolai M. Josuttis : The C++ Standard Library, 2nd edition: A Tutorial
and Reference. Addison-Wesley, 2012. A specific tutorial on the library, with
C++11.

      (7) JTC1/SC22/WG21 — The C++ Standards Committee : Latest publicly available
draft: N3797 Wor king Draft, Standard for Prog ramming Language
C++. 2013-10-13.

      (8) Bjarne Stroustrup : The Design and Evolution of C++. Addison-Wesley,
1994. This is a historical document where Stroustrup discusses his design
philosophy and how it derived from C with Classes.

      (9) P.J. Plauger, Alexander Stepanov, Meng Lee, David Musser : The C++ Standard
Template Library. Prentice-Hall, 2001. Detailed description of the
implementation of the STL, showing detailed code examples.

4. Detailed Syllabus.
  This course is about programming in C++, including C++11. Prior programming
  knowledge of ANSI C is assumed.

      (1) C vs C++. Some differences : Input/output, strings, vectors instead of standard
I/O, character and other arrays. Fundamental data types. Using the
Standard Template Library (STL).

      (2) Functions : pass by value, reference, and const reference. Namespaces.

      (3) Classes : interface and implementaton. Header files and file guards. Member
functions. Operator and function overloading.

      (4) Input and output streams. User-defined I/O operators. Formatting I/O.
  
      (5) Vectors and free store. Memory management Constructors and destructors.
Copying and assignment of objects. Pointers and references. Shared_ptr and
Unique_ptr.

      (6) Vectors and arrays. Copy and move constructors, and copy and move assignments.
Destructors. Explicit constructors.

      (7) Inheritance polymorphism and object-oriented programming. Abstract classes.
Virtual functions. Overriding functions and operators. Multiple inheritance
as interfaces.

      (8) Template polymorphism and generic programming. Containers and inheritance.
Range checking and resource management. Exceptions : defining,
throwing, and catching.

      (9) Containers and iterators in the standard library. Vectors, lists, and strings.
Algorithms and maps.

      (10) Graphical user interfaces (GUI). Threads. Sockets. Client/server applications.
      
      (11) Miscellaneous other topics : TBA.
